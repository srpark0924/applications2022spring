        <h1 style="margin-bottom:50px;">Research: UI Conventions</h1>

        <h2>Nike</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        The first thing I see is the navigation bar on the top. Then my eye sight moves from the left to right, where I see “New Releases”for the first, which makes me want to click first instead of “women” button in order to search for what I need. Logos are located on the left and search bar is located on the right with likes and shopping cart buttons. Under the navigation bar, advertisement banner is located with automatic shift animation, which makes me click if I am interested in certain promotion as well as uses the space efficiently, When I hover “Women” in the menu, I see lists of categories and types of shoes I am looking for. In a new page, I see the header UI as well as the advertisement banner still the same. I see 3rows of products with an image in a rectangular shape, title, category, and prices are listed as a preview. Filter function is set in default on the left, but “Hide filters” button is located on the right corner next to “Sort By” button, which provides users a choice on how to view the products more efficiently. Hovering each image shows a drop down small preview images with different colors. Did not expect such interaction (hover and drop down images) because the number of colors were already stated under the title. However, such interaction allows users to scheme through quickly without additional click. This helps me to decide which one to view additional information in a new page. While proceeding to checkout, all the summary is shown in one page. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Harley Davidson</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        There are two sections of navigation bars: one on the top and the other below the ad. banner. I believe the purpose of it is to expose various categories once more to the users. Different from Nike website, filter section is located above the product images. Instead of showing the lists of subcategories, the website uses accordion menu. Another unique interaction is when the user hovers the product, the image drops down and shows different view of the product. Such interaction showing two different views before entering into the detailed page, allows viewers to quickly navigate through the products and find what they need. Unlike the Nike website, it provides “quick view” providing additional information without entering into a new page. Order summary is shown in one page but has multiple loading pages, which distract the users from quickly proceeding to checkout. In the section page where all the products are listed, I think the website put emphasis on the preview interaction so that the users would not leave the website because of inconvenience.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Amazon</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        Like google search bar, Amazon search bar also dominates the header section as the users who visit the website immediately search for what they need. Categories are listed not only on the navigation bar but also on the advertisement section underneath. An unique interaction is that there are suggestions buttons for the users based on the big data of their order histories. After I search for the white mask, first item I see is “Amazon’s choice.” Not sure about its company’s credibility, but makes me want to click as it is highlighted in red. I scroll down a little and see if there is a design I want. However, in the end result in clicking “Amazon’s choice.” I see different color choices and different prices, and scroll down to see the details. Because I already have an account, I have much simpler process of “Buy now.” This interaction allows me to reduce the specific proceeding process. One button finishes the order. It successfully reduces the amount of energy and time for the users to place an order.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Best Buy</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        First thing I see is the sign up pop-up. I am not interested in it, so close the pop up. I see a big button that says “Menu.,” and next to it is the search bar. Under the search bar, there is a navigation bar, which does not have a hover function but opens a new page. When click the “Menu” button, a drop down menu appears, which is vertical rather than horizontal. When click one of the categories, it opens up submenu horizontally like an accordion. Because I am looking for specific electric scooter, I do not want to waste time finding the right category in the menu, so search for the product right away. I see filter function on the left side, and different types of products are listed as an image on the top part, rather than showing the lists of items right away. iItems are listed with one column, and the prices and their saving are the top hierarchies with big letters. In the process of proceeding to check out, new pages appear as the user moves on to the next step. This feels a long journey and if something goes wrong, it needs to be started from the beginning again. 
        </p>

        <h2>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        General flow of the purchase is the same. Search bar takes the priority, and it is the first thing the user sees, next to the logo. Navigation bar and menu are located on the top, and shopping cart and likes are located on the top right corner of the page. Filter section is located on the left side, UI-wise distinctly separated from the lists of items. When hover the menu, drop down menu appears with subcategories. If the user is not a member, pop-up block or a new page appears asking the user to sign up right before proceeding to checkout. 
        </p>

        <h2>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        Amazon particularly includes lots of information in the title of the item. It also includes the shipping dates which is an additional helpful information before entering into the specific page. Depending on the how important “search” function is in the website, the sizes of the search bar are slightly different. Amazon has aa strength on quick purchase, it has additional button, “Buy now,” which immediately completes the order with once click. Best Buy website has one column with an image and information taking all the horizontal space. The order of the filter is slightly different as the purpose of the website and the products of each website are different. </p>

        <h2>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        Amazon focused on the search tool as well as the check out procedure: quickness as well as many product choices are vital to the purchase. Nike has a strength on simpleness of the menu and the filter is also well organized and easy to understand. Best Buy has focused on the categories: make sure the users find what they need specifically from the category buttons. Harley Davidson has a strength in viewing the products’ specifics from the first page, but because of that other filter functions are not that useful. </p>

        <h2>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        Nike and Harley Davidson’s hover interactions are unique and lead users to quickly navigate through the products and quickly make decisions. Furthermore, such interaction provides an impression that the user is interacting with the products, which I believe encourages users not to leave the website. Hover state, drop down menu could be applied to Best Buy as well as current interaction is too still and arouse too much clicks. Lastly, the varieties to the use of space when listing the product are unique such as how Amazon organizes the products with sometimes videos as well as one product taking the whole horizontal space. However, it is critical to think about whether such technique would work in other websites regardless of the size of the company.  
        </p>

        <h2>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        Personally, I enjoyed every hover state that the website has, other than the squared buttons, especially Nike website. I do not need to click a lot, but rather if I hover the button or image, I get the information I need. I think such technique provides comfort and no waste of energy to purchase a product. Harley Davidson’s loading page was very disrupted. No other website has a loading page, but Harley Davidson has a black rough loading page in every moment. Best Buy’s filter function was not necessarily helpful as all the categories and information were already shown in other sections, so it felt a little redundant.
