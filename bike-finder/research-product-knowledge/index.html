        The most important information that the bike users seek for before purchasing a bike would be what are the things to consider in various circumstances. I began my research by searching for the process of bugying a bike. The website called <a href="https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/the-draft/buying-a-bike/" target="_blank">THE DRAFT</a> is for the beginners to follow step by step and successfully search for the best bike fit for them. Another great website is called <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bicycle.html" target="_blank">REI</a>, that not only includes specific information to consider such as types, cost, performance, fits, but also each of their images and videos to consider. Furthermore, the strength of this website is that it provides links to each categories to REI shop. I also looked into <a href="https://www.performancebike.com/" target="_blank">Performance Bicycle</a>, <a href="https://www.jensonusa.com/">Jenson</a> to learn about each store's products, features, techniques, marketing and store's strength that differentiates from other stores. <a href="https://intheknowcycling.com/online-bike-store-rankings/" target="_blank">Bike stores rankings</a> webiste is also worth notable as the ranking could provide some general aspects that the users prefer and enjoy buying.

        <h2>What priorities might they have?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        The top sale brands(reputation), how specific the information is listed, reviews, and which bike is the most suitable to the buyer's purpose of buying, value&price, promotions/deals, (+ is this website providing the best sale?)

        <h2>What did you run into that you didn't understand, and now you do?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:50px;">
        There were couple of websites that had abrupt pop-ups not only for sign ups but also promotion advertisements. It could have been better if there is a checkbox that asks for "stop seeing for 6hours," so that the users have an option to view it or not. Moreover, there were some times when I had some difficulties finding the descriptions and additional information about the bike becuase of the recommendations and advertisements. I had to scroll down a lot and spend time looking for it.
