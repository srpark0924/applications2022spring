        <h2>Tester1</h2>
        <h4>Persona: Commuter John Johnson - As a person with back pain, I want to be able to find the right size and style of bike so that I don't injure my back further.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For the intro page, the questionaire section, providing an option for the user to close the questionaire is clear and user centered way to easily visit and exit.
            </li>
            <li>
                The title and the information/questionaire that follows are not matching very well -> a bit confusing -> how about changing the title of the questionaire -> for example, "What bike should I get?" -> show what the end result would be.
            </li>
            <li>
                The arrow indication for the size of bike that the user is looking for is not clear. Why would anyone not want the perfect size?
            </li>
            <li>
                Indication of how many pages/questionaire there are is clear and a nice user centered UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the main page where the bike image takes the whole page looks like a button (but could be because of current low-fidelity UI).
            </li>
            <LI>
                Since there is a "like" button in the navigation bar, how about thinking about adding like/heart icon on the products as well.
            </LI>
            <li>
                Because the commuter has no background knowledge about the bike, there is no need to use the filter function. -> It could be a good idea to think about beginner friendly section or filter function. For example, what terrain? help button? with which purpose matches with which kind of wheel?
            </li>
            <li>
                In the product detail page, "change button" button next to the title need more clear naming.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instead of "next step" button, how about changing its title to "add to cart."
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tester2</h2>
        <h4>Persona: Casual Rider Ava Windsor - As a casual rider I want a bike that is easy to use so that I don't have to put in a lot of maintenance on it.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Title for the questionaire is confusing as the following questions are not about the bike but about the user. How about "tell us about yourself." -> height and weight. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the main page, having two big images when the srolls down feels too much. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the menu section, instead of "types of bikes," how about just "bikes,"for the consistency of other sections in the menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the product detail page, back button is missing.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the product list page, filter infos are not shown/clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sizes and overall composition of the product images as well as the descriptions are clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the detail page -> carry header for the consistency
            </li>
            <li>
                "Next step" title is vauge -> maybe "check out"?
            </li>
            <li>
                "change" button is not clear -> "Change the product or view other products".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tester3</h2>
        <h4>h4ersona: Experienced Cyclist Shannon Ramirez - As an experienced cyclist, I want a high quality mountain bike so that I can ride on steeper inclines and be safe when putting a breake in muddy grounds.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Menu -> men and women -> bikes are usually unisex
            </li>
            <li>
                No indication of whether the chosen product is collapsible. Weight information is needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigation bar is not shown in the product detail page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Global footer is needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tester4</h2>
        <h4>Persona: Casual Rider Ava Windsor - As a mother I want a bike that is safe to ensure my well being.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                After the survey/questionaire, filter, specifics should be indicated for the users to understand which filters/details were applied.
            </li>
            <li>
                Too many pages/questions could be too much or burdensome.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the main page, when scrolled down, what are the contents? not clear enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the menu, for user who visited for the health purpose, not very helpful.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the product page, hierarchy for the filter section is vital, especially for the beginners.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Change" button's title is not clear enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the product detail page, options section is taking too much space. How about having both option section and descriptions section located in the same space.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            After four different users' user testing, repeated feedbacks were unclear labels of the buttons. I tried to be concise in order to save space for other details of the design, and I believed that the users would be familiar with those terms so those labels would be easy to understand. However, because they were too concise and simple, it had not enough information for the users to understand. Moreover, navigation section and footer sections are vital in every page not only for the consistency but also for the users to easily navigate to other pages as well. Back buttons were missing in most of my pages, which can be solved if I put the navigation bar in every page. Lastly, because bike webiste requires many filters as there are many varieties of bikes, it is important to indicate which filters/details have been applied to the current product lists. This would help the users which filter is necessary and which is not. When building a high-fidelity wireframe, it is also important where specific details of the product should be placed and how much should be shown in the preview page.
