            Based on the Personas as well as User stories, one of the most important aspects was to tackle the usersâ€™ needs. Understanding the purpose of the user visiting this website is the outmost importance I will be focusing on for the website I will be making. In order to fulfill that point, on the landing page, before viewing the main page, the first thing that the user will be viewing will be the survey-like questionnaire like the example of Zara size search. This questionnaire will ask about the purpose of visiting, what the user is looking for, what types of bikes are available, the range of budget the user has, color preference, size preference, etc. This would reduce the amount of effort/energy and time that the user would use while navigating through the menu as well as all the filters. However, there will definitely be an exit button or a skip button so that not only the first visitors who do not necessarily need it or feels like it is a burden or long time visitors who has already done it and the record already remains do not have to go through all the process. Menu will be shown in the center where the users can easily find. In the sub page where the bikes are shown, hover function will be the critical interaction that could navigate the users to the details without clicking and moving to the new page. Lastly, for the new users who do not have contact information shown, if the user puts in the card number, then it automatically record the user information, so all the user needs to complete is the shipping address. This way of method would clearly reduce the amount of time and effort.
